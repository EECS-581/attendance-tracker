# EECS 581 Project: Attendance Tracker


## About this repo
- This repo contains code for the web and mobile app components of the attendance tracker project. 

## Contribute to mobile development
The mobile component was created using [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) and [react native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

2. Set up your environment according to the [expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/)
2. Clone this repository
3. cd into the repo locally and run "yarn install"
4. cd into the attendance-tracker-app folder and run "npx expo start." Expo should start a local server and Metro Bundler will generate a QR code, which you can scan with your phone to simulate the app on your mobile device
