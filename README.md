# EECS 581 Project: Attendance Tracker


## About this repo
- This repo contains code for the web and mobile app components of the attendance tracker project. 



## Contribute to mobile development
The mobile component was created using [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) and [react native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) 

To contribute:

1. Download the Expo Go app on your mobile device 
2. Set up your environment according to the [expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/)
2. Clone this repository
3. cd into the repo locally and run "yarn install"
4. cd into the attendance-tracker-app folder and run "npx expo start." Expo should start a local server and Metro Bundler will generate a QR code, which you can scan with your phone to simulate the app on your mobile device
5. Xcode and Android studio tools allow you to run emulators on your computer as well
