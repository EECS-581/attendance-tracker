/*
 * Prologue Comments
 * Name of code artifact: AttendanceToken Deployment Script
 * Brief description: This script deploys the AttendanceToken contract to the Mumbai testnet using ethers.js.
 * Programmerâ€™s name: Hudson Headley
 * Date the code was created: 9-21-23

 * 
 * Preconditions:
 * - The environment variable PRIVATE_KEY must be correctly set in the project's .env file, representing
 *   the private key of the deploying account.
 * - The ABI and bytecode of AttendanceToken must be correctly imported.
 * 
 * Postconditions:
 * - The AttendanceToken contract is deployed to the Mumbai testnet and the address at which the contract
 *   is deployed is logged to the console.
 * 
 * Error and exception condition values or types that can occur:
 * - If the PRIVATE_KEY environment variable is not set, the deployment will fail.
 * - If the ABI or bytecode is incorrect, the deployment will fail.
 * - Any errors during the deployment will be caught and logged to the console.
 * 
 * Side effects:
 * - Deploys a new instance of the AttendanceToken contract to the Mumbai testnet.
 * 
 * Invariants:
 * - The ethers.js library, the ABI, and the bytecode of the contract must remain constant during the execution
 *   of this script.
 * 
 * Any known faults:
 * - Lack of error handling for scenarios where the environment variable PRIVATE_KEY is not properly set.
 *
