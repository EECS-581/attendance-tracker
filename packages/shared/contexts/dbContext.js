/* 
 * Prologue Comments
 * Name of code artifact: DbContext Provider
 * Brief description: This code defines a React context named dbContext and a provider 
 * named DbProvider for this context. The context is meant to provide functionalities related to 
 * database, specifically, it has a function to upload data to IPFS.
 * Programmerâ€™s name: Hudson Headley
 * Date the code was created: 9/24/23

 * Preconditions:
 * - It assumes that a Web3Context is available and properly set up in the app.
 * - The ethers library and ipfs object must be correctly installed and imported.
 * 
 * Postconditions:
 * - Provides a context with a function that allows uploading strings to IPFS.
 * 
 * Error and exception condition values or types that can occur:
 * - Any errors or exceptions during the IPFS upload are not handled in this code.
 * 
 * Side effects:
 * - Console logs the result of the IPFS upload.
 * 
 * Invariants:
 * - The Web3Context must remain constant for the duration of the component's lifecycle.
 * 
 * Any known faults:
 * - Lack of error handling in the uploadTest function.
 *
